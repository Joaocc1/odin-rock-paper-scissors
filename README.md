# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is the third project of the Foundations path from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/).

It's the first project to include Javascript and initially will not have a GUI. The game will be played on the console.

This project has proven to be fairly simple and not too complicated to finish. It was a good refresher on some concepts and was good practice to implement the problem solving approach taught in the previous lessons.

It was a bit more challenging when trying to implement a function to play the game in 5 rounds since I struggled a bit with making the playRound() function, that plays 1 round, to work once inside the main function, playGame(). In the end the solution I found was to also move the variables that hold the human and computer choices inside the playGame() function.
